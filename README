A very good (fast) random number generator from Geroge Marsaglia.

Here's the paper: http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper

I just ported it to Java as it lacks usigned type, and it's paper's xor128() equivalent (tested it).

It's probably the best bet if you need good and fast PRNG for some monte carlo or other statistical simulations, not for cryptography though.
