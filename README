A very good (fast) random number generator from Geroge Marsaglia.

Here's the paper: http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i14/paper

I just ported it to Java as it lacks usigned type, it's paper's xor128() equivalent (tested it).

That is probably your best bet if you need a good and fast PRNG for some monte carlo or other statistical simulations, not for cryptography though.
